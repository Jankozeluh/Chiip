# Chiip — Decision Log

## D-001 — Engine: Godot 4.7.2 with GDScript (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** Godot 4.7.2, standard edition, scripted in GDScript.

**Why:** It's already installed. GDScript is Godot's main language, with the most tutorials and the tightest editor integration, and needs no .NET setup.

**Alternatives:** C#, which is familiar from Unity but needs the .NET edition of Godot and the .NET SDK, and has fewer Godot examples.

## D-002 — Genre: CS-style tactical FPS, single-player against bots (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** A 3D tactical FPS modeled on Counter-Strike, played single-player against bots first.

**Why:** The user mostly plays CS (1.6, CS:GO, CS2) and Quake. With bots, the game can be built and tested alone, while multiplayer would complicate every system from day one.

**Alternatives:** A Quake-style arena shooter, multiplayer from the start, or a movement and aim playground without enemies.

## D-003 — Art style: retro Quake look (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** Low-res rendering, pixelated textures and simple geometry, in the style of Quake and CS 1.x.

**Why:** It fits the games that inspired Chiip, and simple art is realistic for a one-person hobby project.

**Alternatives:** A plain prototype blockout, or free low-poly asset packs.

## D-004 — Name: Chiip (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** The game is called **Chiip**, and its folder is `Games/Chiip/`.

**Why:** Chosen by the user.

## D-005 — Approach: playable milestones, learn as we go (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** Claude builds the game step by step and explains each new Godot concept, compared to Unity, so the user can make changes themselves. Each milestone ends with something playable. Chiip is an ongoing project, with no fixed end date.

**Why:** The user has Unity experience but is new to Godot, and wants to learn it.

**Alternatives:** Claude builds everything with little explanation, or the user codes and Claude only assists.

## D-006 — Everything is documented (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** A `docs/` folder holds the plan, game design, architecture, decisions, devlog and learning notes. Code has doc comments. The rules for keeping all of it current are in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Why:** The user asked for it. It also lets an ongoing project be resumed easily after a break.

## D-007 — Units and reference values (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** 1 Godot unit = 1 metre. Counter-Strike values are converted with 1 Source unit ≈ 2.54 cm.

**Why:** Metres are Godot's convention, which also keeps physics behaving as expected. Converting CS values gives a familiar feel to start from.

## D-008 — Renderer: Forward+ (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** Use the Forward+ renderer.

**Why:** It's Godot's most capable desktop renderer and supports everything planned for the retro look, including baked lightmaps (M3). Performance isn't a concern for low-poly retro scenes.

**Alternatives:** Mobile (fewer features, aimed at phones), Compatibility (OpenGL, for very old hardware and the web).

## D-009 — Physics engine: Jolt (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** Set `physics/3d/physics_engine` to **Jolt Physics** explicitly.

**Why:** Jolt is built into Godot and is faster and more stable than the older GodotPhysics3D, especially with many bodies (bots, ragdolls, grenades later). Setting it explicitly means the project doesn't depend on what "DEFAULT" means in a given Godot version.

**Alternatives:** GodotPhysics3D, Godot's original engine.

## D-010 — 128 physics ticks per second, with physics interpolation (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** Physics runs at 128 Hz, like 128-tick community CS servers (FACEIT). Physics interpolation is on, and the jitter fix is off, as Godot recommends with interpolation.

**Why:** A higher tick rate means input reaches the movement code sooner and movement is simulated more precisely. Physics interpolation draws objects smoothly *between* ticks, so movement looks smooth on any monitor refresh rate (60, 120 or 144 Hz) without being tied to it. The cost of 128 Hz is negligible for one player and a handful of bots.

**Alternatives:** 60 Hz (Godot's default), 64 Hz (CS2/CS:GO matchmaking), or no interpolation (cheaper, but can stutter when the monitor and tick rates differ).

**Consequence:** The camera can't simply be a child of the player. It's updated every rendered frame from the player's smoothed position, while mouse look is applied directly with no delay. See `player/player.gd`.

## D-011 — World gravity: CS's 800 units/s² (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** Project-wide gravity (`physics/3d/default_gravity`) is 20.32 m/s², which is CS's `sv_gravity 800` converted to metres.

**Why:** CS movement and jump heights are tuned for this gravity. Setting it project-wide means everything that falls (players, grenades, ragdolls) uses the same value. Real-world gravity is 9.8 m/s², but CS has always felt "heavier" than reality.

## D-012 — Keys are bound by physical position (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** All keyboard bindings use *physical* keycodes, meaning the position of the key, not the letter printed on it. Jump is also bound to mouse wheel down, as many CS players do.

**Why:** The user has a Czech QWERTZ keyboard, where Y and Z are swapped and the number row types `ěščřžýáíé`. With physical keycodes, WASD and the number keys (weapon slots from M2) stay in the same place on any layout.

**Alternatives:** Letter-based keycodes, which would break on non-US layouts.

## D-013 — Stairs use invisible clip ramps (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** Stairs are visual only. Players walk on an invisible collision ramp laid over the step edges, like the "clip brushes" on many CS maps. There's no code for stepping up onto ledges for now.

**Why:** It's simple and smooth, and it's how CS maps usually handle stairs. Godot's `CharacterBody3D` doesn't climb steps by itself, and step-up code is tricky to get right.

**Alternatives:** Step-up code in the player, which can be added later if maps need small ledges (curbs, door frames) that players should walk over.

## D-014 — Blockout with CSG and a grid shader (2026-10-15)

**Decision:** The M1 test map is built from CSG shapes (`CSGBox3D`, with a subtraction for the tunnel) using a world-space grid shader as a placeholder "developer texture". Box heights match CS's standard 32/48/64/80-unit crates.

**Why:** CSG is built in and editable right in the Godot editor, so it's ideal for quick blockouts. The 1 m grid makes speed and distances easy to judge. The final map workflow is decided in M3.

## Open questions

| Question | Decide in |
|---|---|
| On macOS, does Ctrl + click clash with crouch + shoot? | M1 |
| Low-res rendering approach: window stretch, SubViewport or 3D resolution scale? | M3 |
| Map building: Godot CSG, or TrenchBroom with `func_godot`? | M3 |
| Team sizes: 1 vs N, or 5v5 with bot teammates? | M5 |
| Weapon names | M6 |
| Team names and the game's setting/theme | Any time |
